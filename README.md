# Spotify-clone-only-frontend-Bootstrap

This project is a Spotify-inspired web player interface created using HTML, CSS, and Font Awesome. It mimics some of the key elements of a music streaming platform, including a sidebar for navigation, a main content area for music suggestions, and a fixed music player at the bottom. The layout is responsive for desktop screens, with hover states and button styles for a polished look. Font Awesome icons are used to enhance the visual aesthetics and maintain a clean, modern design. Additionally, range sliders are implemented for playback and volume controls, providing a basic interactive feel.

Technologies Used :-
